# MarineSensing
Marine Sensing point trace data fusion involves processing the sensing data in the unit of geographical points from multiple ship platforms. This data includes the navigation information recorded by the ship's own sensors and navigation equipment, the point traces measured by the navigation radar installed on the ship, and the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data actively transmitted by other vessels and received by the AIS equipment equipped on the ship. The system identifies and matches the multi-source detection data of the same target but from different sources, so as to achieve the correction of the radar system error and the discovery of abnormal targets.
